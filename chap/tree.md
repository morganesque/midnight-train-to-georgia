It was a cemetery this field. Almost a hundred thousand came to lay here. They are still lying now, under the grass. Gone. Forgotten. Never to return except in the form of the trees which push up into the sky all around. Life turned to death and back to life again. One tree in particular, an oak planted dead centre, looms larger than the rest.

until her feet finally come to rest on a high branch of a tall tree. She hops a couple of times and ruffles her feathers, getting herself comfortable, and then after settling she turns and looks for the first time at the man who is crouched just a little way along the branch beside her.
