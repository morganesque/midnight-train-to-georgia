It used to be a cemetery this field. Almost a hundred thousand came to lay here. They are still lying now, under the grass. Gone, forgotten, never to return except in the form of the trees and plants which push upwards all around. Life turned to death and back to life again. One tree in particular, an oak planted dead centre, looms larger than the rest. It's great splayed branches reaching up and outwards from a huge trunk.

It's here that her feet finally come to rest, on a high branch. She hops a couple of times and ruffles her feathers, getting herself comfortable, and then after settling she turns and looks for the first time at the man who is crouched just a little way along the branch beside her.
