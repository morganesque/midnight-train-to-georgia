An oak planted dead central with a small path circling it and path-spokes leading out from it. It rises a full 30 metres into the sky dwarfing all the other trees around it.

The oak is a huge old beast, big and bushy like a brain. Gnarled and splayed like an idea left too long to ferment. Reaching up and out from an enormous trunk then branching thinner and thinner until it's tips flutter like ideas rarely thought of. It has been damaged over the years. Struck by lightning and by dangerous ideas. It memory is vast, but there are gaps where branches have fallen or even lopped off by those in whose charge she has found herself and who in their good intentions have applied themselves too enthusiastically to her trimming. 

It used to be a cemetery this field. Almost a hundred thousand came to lay here. They are still lying now, under the grass. Gone, forgotten, never to return except in the form of the trees and plants which push upwards all around. Life turned to death and back to life again. One tree in particular, an oak planted dead centre, looms larger than the rest. It's great splayed branches reaching up and outwards from a huge trunk.

It's here that her feet finally come to rest, on a high branch. She hops a couple of times and ruffles her feathers, getting herself comfortable, and then after settling she turns and looks for the first time at the man who is crouched just a little way along the branch beside her.
