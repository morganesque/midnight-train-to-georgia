The crow flies north. Over the ocean heading for The City of Leeds. The wind whips around her and a low early morning sun glitters gently across the crinkling sea below. She can see the coastline now and the city creeping away beyond it. Gulls roll around her, cawing their own distinctive caws but she sees and hears nothing of them. She is focussed. Though her destination is at present invisible, nestled up and towards the back of the city in amongst some buildings, she knows exactly where she's heading.

Approaching the beach she sees the sand gathered up against little half-submerged red structures. The remains of a town; Morely or more probably Beeston. What used to be streets and houses now sodden and worn like shells, the waves lapping against them and through them. Their roofs all gone, like mouths gasping their last of the salty air before they sink completely.

She has a constellation in her head, three stars that'll guide her in. A pattern from the heavens recreated below for those who may arrive, or indeed return, from afar. A trinity of human concerns: Learning, Politics and Commerce, each made monumentally manifest by the city dwellers over the years. She passes Commerce first, huge, solid swelling up in front of her, reaching higher then even now she is flying. Uniform, blank, reflecting her own image back at her. Politics comes next, this time with a moving face to time her passing. It squats toad-like in the city, clutching it's legs about it. Always watching, always fearful. Looking up she sees Learning, clean, white and towering up at the top of the hill. This is her destination. The crisp proud lines of it's form facing back down the hill, and at the same time pointing upwards to something better.

She pauses on a rooftop near by and takes a rest. Strange, she thinks, to stop so near to her destination, but the urge to pause for a second takes over. After a long journey, a moment to stop and savor before the end, before the beginning. She has no physical cargo but nevertheless what she carries weighs her down. She longs to let it go and yet knows that losing it will cause her sorrow. Maybe that's why she's paused here, just to spend a few more seconds carrying it. Who knows.

Hopping gently off her ledge she swoops down and continues and coming to the clock tower she circles it twice, almost like paying respects, then she pulls away to fly over the Library and Clothworkers building before gliding out over the grassy area beyond.
