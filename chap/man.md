The man sits on his branch still as stone. Staring, it seems, into the distant east toward the rising sun. He is wearing a grey suit, not old but worn and tattered at the edges. he seems wet from the early morning dew perhaps but maybe too much for that. He is crouched, bent double, black shoes poking down over the branch and his knees drawn up to his chest. A black tie hangs from his neck. One hand is grasping a slightly higher branch and the other hand holds a suitcase which dangles down beside him like ballast. He is absolutely still. The crow hops again and the branch makes a creaking kind of sound. The man makes no movement. A damp besuited statue staring towards the sun.
