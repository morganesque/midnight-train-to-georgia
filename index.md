The crow flies north. Over the ocean heading for The City of Leeds. The surf flecked wind whips around her and the sun twinkles across the gently crinkled sea below. It's a clear day. She can see down towards the city where the sand rises out of the waves and creeps back up the hill. Gulls roll around her, cawing their own distinctive caws but she sees and hears nothing of them. She is focussed. Her destination is at present invisible, nestled up and towards the back of the city behind some grey buildings still intact.

Now she approaches the beach, sand gathered up against half-submerged grey structures. Brutal concrete angles pointing up towards her. What used to be solid and vital now worn and tired, their last grasping attempt at air before they sink entirely. Beyond the beach the salty sinking towns.
